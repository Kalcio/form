## Installation

Install the library using Composer:

```shell
composer require derafu/form
```

## Development Requirements

To render forms using JSON Forms you must install:

```shell
npm install @jsonforms/core @jsonforms/react @jsonforms/material-renderers \
    react react-dom @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```

This is already included in the package by default, so you just need to run it:

```shell
npm install
```
